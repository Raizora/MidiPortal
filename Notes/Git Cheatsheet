1. Create a Temporary Branch: This will save your current state.
    git checkout -b temp-save

2. Continue Working: You can now make changes, try new things, etc.

3. Revert to the Saved State: If you want to go back to the saved state, you can switch back to the temporary branch.
   git checkout temp-save

4. Save Again or Merge Changes: If you decide to keep the changes you made, you can merge them back into your main branch or save them in the temporary branch.
   git checkout main
   git merge temp-save

5. Delete the Temporary Branch: Once you're done and no longer need the temporary save, you can delete the branch.
   git branch -d temp-save
