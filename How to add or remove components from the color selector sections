Removing a Component:

To remove a component, follow these steps:
	1.	Remove its declaration from the ColorSection struct.
	2.	Remove its initialization in the constructor.
	3.	Remove its addAndMakeVisible call.
	4.	Remove its positioning code from the resized() method.

The layout will automatically adjust when components are removed since we're using JUCE's layout system with removeFromTop/Left/Right.

Customizing Component Appearance with LookAndFeel:

To customize the appearance of specific JUCE components (like text size in RGB value boxes), you can create a custom LookAndFeel class:

1. Create a custom class that inherits from juce::LookAndFeel_V4:
```cpp
class CustomLookAndFeel : public juce::LookAndFeel_V4 {
public:
    // Override methods to customize appearance
};
```

2. Override specific methods to customize appearance. For example, to change font size for specific labels:
```cpp
juce::Font getLabelFont(juce::Label& label) override {
    // Use component hierarchy to target specific labels
    if (auto* parent = label.getParentComponent()) {
        if (dynamic_cast<juce::ColourSelector*>(parent->getParentComponent()) != nullptr) {
            return juce::Font(12.0f);  // Custom font size for these labels only
        }
    }
    return LookAndFeel_V4::getLabelFont(label);  // Default for other labels
}
```

3. Apply the custom LookAndFeel to components:
```cpp
// Create a static instance (or manage lifetime appropriately)
static CustomLookAndFeel customLookAndFeel;

// Apply to a component
myComponent->setLookAndFeel(&customLookAndFeel);
```

4. Clean up in destructor:
```cpp
// Remove custom LookAndFeel before component destruction
myComponent->setLookAndFeel(nullptr);
```

Key Points:
- LookAndFeel is JUCE's way of centralizing styling and behavior customization
- You can override various methods to customize:
  - Font sizes and styles
  - Colors
  - Component layouts
  - Drawing behavior
- Use component hierarchy checks to target specific components
- Always manage LookAndFeel lifetime properly to avoid dangling pointers
- Remember to remove custom LookAndFeel before component destruction
